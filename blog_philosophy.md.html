<h1 id="blog-philosophy">Blog philosophy</h1>
<ul>
<li>My time is precious to me. Few things irk me more than 5 pages of
faff before starting content that is relevant to the blog title. I
prefer concise and clear explanations.</li>
<li>Different readers will have different levels of knowledge on the
topic. Most will understand at least some of the content and want to be
able to skip to the part they donâ€™t yet understand. Others will require
and in depth explanation from the beginning. This blog aims to cater to
both.</li>
<li>There is tradeoff between simplicity and functionality. Often it is
good to start with sensible defults making it much easier to get
started, only later adding additional functionality as this comes with
added complexity.</li>
</ul>
