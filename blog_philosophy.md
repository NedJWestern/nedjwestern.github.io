# Blog philosophy

- My time is precious to me. Few things irk me more than 5 pages of faff before starting content that is relevant to the blog title. I prefer concise and clear explanations.
- Different readers will have different levels of knowledge on the topic. Most will understand at least some of the content and want to be able to skip to the part they don't yet understand. Others will require and in depth explanation from the beginning. This blog aims to cater to both.
- There is tradeoff between simplicity and functionality. Often it is good to start with sensible defults making it much easier to get started, only later adding additional functionality as this comes with added complexity.
